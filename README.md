## Hi there 👋
##### About Me

I’m a Senior Business & Data Analyst who has spent the last 16+ years translating "Data-Speak" into "Human-Speak." 

Most of my career has been spent in the worlds of Retail and Supply Chain, where I help businesses figure out why their data is messy and how to make it profitable. I have a strange affection for complex SQL joins and a firm belief that a well-designed Tableau dashboard is basically a work of art.

**A few things about my professional journey:**
* 🧠 **I’ve seen it all:** From legacy databases that required a prayer to run, to modern Python-powered stacks. 
* 🕵️‍♀️ **Data Detective:** I actually enjoy the challenge of taking a chaotic dataset and finding the "hidden truth" buried in the rows.
* 📦 **Warehouse to Wallet:** I specialize in the journey products take from the shipping dock to the customer's hands, making sure no profit is leaked along the way.
* ☕ **Powered by:** Strong **Ginger Tea**, curiosity, and the satisfaction of a query that runs perfectly on the first try (though we all know that's rare).
When I'm not untangling data, I'm usually building independent projects to stay sharp in retail market grow one insight at a time.
