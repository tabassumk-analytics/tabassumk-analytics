## Hi there 👋
##### About Me

I am a Senior Business and Data Analyst with over 16 years of experience in the field. Throughout my career, I have focused on the Retail and Supply Chain industries, helping businesses make sense of their data to improve how they operate.

My work is built on the belief that data should be simple and useful. I enjoy the challenge of taking a messy dataset and turning it into a clear story that helps a business move forward. Over the last decade and a half, I have developed a deep expertise in using SQL and Python to organize information and Tableau to make it visual and easy to understand.

I have spent a significant portion of my career looking at how products move from warehouses to customers and finding ways to make that process more profitable.
